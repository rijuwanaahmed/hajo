            <p>Hajo is a town which has religious places of different faiths, such as Hindus, Muslims and the Buddhists. The Muslim place of pilgrimage in Hajo is Powa Mecca Mosque. The name of the mosque means one quarter of Mecca, which is the holiest city for the Muslims situated in Arab. It is said that by offering prayers in this mosque, devotees gain one fourth of the good grace that they would have gotten in the real Mecca. On the top of Garurachal hill, the Powa Mecca mosque stands. This is the tomb of the pioneer of Muslim religion in this area, Pir Ghiyasuddin Auliya. In 1657 AD, Sujauddin Muhammad Shah had built this mosque. At that time Shah Jahan was the ruling Mughal emperor of India. The mosque is situated on the hill over the banks of the Brahmaputra River and is only 24 kms away from Guwahati. This is a shrine where not only the Muslims, but the Hindus also come to offer their prayers. The temple of Hayagriva Madhaba is just on the side of the mosque. . </p>
